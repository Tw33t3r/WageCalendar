# WageCalendar
Currently rudimentary calendar that calculates wage with labor costs

Most of the work here was in creating UI in native Java. Overriding normal buttons was enough for me to consider this project worth it.

There's a lot in TODO for CalPanel.
A reader and saver needs to be created to read and store data.

This should be reprogrammed to be a resizeable window.
